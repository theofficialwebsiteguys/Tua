        <p class="review-text">The food and service are excellent.  I have to give this restaurant kudos for maintaining their quality.  Many restaurants are force to switch suppliers as cost have gone up.  But, Tua Cocina still continues to use the finest ingredients and supplies to make their food.</p>

        <p class="review-text">We love this place! Super authentic Mexican cuisine where you always feel welcome! The people here are so friendly and helpful. Margaritas are so good!! I got the spicy and my husband got the classic.
          Food was fantastic! We loved the enchiladas mole poblano, the cheese enchilada, bean burrito, and chicken flautas! Not to mention the starter mini cheese quesadilla, and dessert banana chimichanga. Everything was super fresh and absolutely delicious.
          We will definitely be back!! Muchas Gracias!!</p>

        <p class="review-text">Huge foodie here: We regularly (& happily) drive 45 minutes each direction because the food, service and humans here are unmatched. Food is fresh, flavorful, and we have never tasted anything that wasnâ€™t absolutely delicious. Shrimp fajitas are insane, salsa is delicious, chimichangas are fried to perfection and music is always a blast. Walls are hand painted with beautiful murals. Perfect location for a fun date night or family celebration/dinner. Prices are also so affordable! 10/10 recommend. You wonâ€™t regret it ðŸ˜ŠðŸ’ƒ</p>
